Create a lightweight, SEO-friendly, professional-looking web app using only HTML, CSS (Tailwind or minimal CSS), and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).

Purpose: A compound interest calculator with variable recurring contributions.

Requirements:
1. User inputs on the left side of the screen:
    - Starting amount
    - One or more contribution segments (add/remove dynamically):
        - Contribution amount
        - Contribution frequency
        - Annual interest rate for that segment (in %)
2. "Add Contribution Period" button to add multiple contribution segments.
3. "Calculate" button that computes compound interest monthly based on the segments.
4. A responsive line chart (using Chart.js) on the right side showing growth over time.
5. Clear summary of final amount and total contributions below the chart.
6. UX should be clean and professional-looking:
    - Use modern fonts
    - Good combination of colors; nothing to bright or flashy.
    - Form should have proper labels, spacing, and validation (e.g., positive numbers)
7. Code should be secure and accessible (no eval, no inline JS, semantic HTML).
8. Entire app should be a single HTML file (with separate CSS and JS files if needed).
9. Ensure it's responsive and mobile-friendly.
10. Include proper meta tags for SEO (title, description, viewport, etc.)
11. Code should be ready to deploy on Netlify or GitHub Pages.

Do not use React or any frontend framework. Only use vanilla JavaScript and Chart.js.
